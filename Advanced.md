# Advanced
## Stance
* Keep your skis close together. When going fast on rough or uneven terrain any difference in your skis can cause instability.
* If your skis are spread out and one hits a bump, either your upper body will be thrown off, or your single leg will have to absorb the whole shock.
* When your skis are together, they both hit the bump and the shock can be absorbed by both legs
## Turning
* Instead of turning your whole body to face sideways, keep your body always facing downhill and switch directions quickly and often.
