# Beginner
## Stance
* Legs apart
* Skis straight
* Knees slightly bend
* Shins pressing against the front of your boots
* Arms held in front to the sides with poles down

## Turning
* Shift your weight to the ski opposite the way you wish to turn.
* As you move, this will cause that ski to catch the snow and force you to turn in the opposite direction.
* Weight on your right ski will move you left.
* Move the arm and pole on the side you are shifting weight to forward.

## S-Turning
* You should move down the mountain by turning one way until you are moving horizontally along the slope, then turning the other way until you are moving horizontally in the other direction.
* Plant your pole in the snow on the inside of each turn for balance.
  * You don't have to put the pole tip all the way in the snow. Tapping the pole to the snow is fine.
* As you turn transition your planted pole arm backwards and the other arm and pole forwards.

## Stopping
### Pizza
* Widen your stance and turn your skis in towards themselves by pigeon-toeing your feet.
* Make sure the tips don't cross.
* This will slow you down until you come to a stop.
#### Plowing
* You can go down the slope by pizza stopping, but flattening your skis to the ground.
* This will slow you down, but not enough to stop causing you to plow down the mountain.
* Not recommended except in an emergency.
### French Fries
* Keep your skis parallel and turn until you are a bit past horizontal to the slope.
* This will slow your until you come to a stop.
