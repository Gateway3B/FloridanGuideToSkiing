# Beginner
## Stance
* Legs apart
* Skis straight
* Knees slightly bend
* Shins pressing against the front of your boots
* Arms held in front to the sides with poles down.

## Turning
* Shift your weight to the ski opposite the way you wish to turn.
* As you move, this will cause that ski to catch the snow and force you to turn in the opposite direction.
* Weight on your right ski will move you left.

## S-Turning
* You should move down the mountain by turning one way until you are moving horizontally along the slope, then turning the other way until you are moving horizontally in the other direction.
* Plant your pole in the snow on the inside of each turn for balance.
