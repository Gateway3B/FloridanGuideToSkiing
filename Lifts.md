# Lifts
## Line Etiquette
* Always alternate. Allow those in the singles line into your group.
## Lift Procedure.
* When the lift for the goup in front of you has swung out, move forward untill your boots are on the stop sign on the ground. Look behind you and sit as the lift reaches your legs. Make sure to ask if everyone is ready before lowering the bar.
## Disembarkment
* Make sure to coordinate who is going in which direction when leaving the lift. Raise the bar at least one suport column before the end. Raise your ski tips, and stand up once your skis are solidly on the ground. The lift will push you forward.
## Old Two Person Lifts
* These lifts do not slow down at the base and to so the lift attendent will swing it back to make it slower when you sit on it. However, this will cause it to accelerate rapidly so make sure you are securely sitting quickly.
## Super Lifts
* Hold 4-6 people. These lifts slow down at the base and top.
