# Equipment
## Skis
1. The length should be between your shoulder and eye level when stood upright.
2. There are three ski levels signifighing how much force is needed to relese the boots from the skis.
    * Beginners should take level 1 because if they fall they want their skis to come off.
    * Expers should take level 3 because when they are going fast, taking tight turns, or skiing mogules, the don't want the ski to randomly pop off.
3. Ski edges should be sharpened metal to catch the snow.
4. Ski bottoms should be waxed to slide on the snow.

### How To Put On
1. Make sure the latch at the back is in the downward position.
    * Use your boot too do this.
2. Place the front of your boot into the forward latch.
3. Firmly put weight on the back of your boot while lining it up with the back latch.
4. The back latch should click into the upward position.

### How To Take Off
1. Lift the bottom of one ski and place the back of it over the back latch of the other ski.
2. Press down to release the latch.
3. Use your freed boot to press down on the other ski's back latch.

### Carrying Skis
1. Hold one ski bottom inward, tip up.
2. Lift the other ski up, place it's bottom to the first ski's bottom, and slide it down.
3. The skis should now be locked together by metal and rubber levers that stick out the bottom when the back latch is down.
4. Hold pair by the first ski's bottom latch while placing the top of the pair on your shoulder.
5. The top ski will not fall because it is now attacked to the bottom ski.

## Boots
1. Boots should be very snug and tight.
2. There should be little wiggle room from side to side.
    * The more wiggle room there is the less control you will have over your skis.
3. Make them as tight as possible.

## Poles
1. Hold the bottom spike of the pole with the pole upside down. With the handle touching the ground, your forearm should be level.

### Wearing Poles
1. Move your glove through the bottom of the strap.
2. With the strap arround the back of your wrist and your hand above and behind the pole, move your hand down and grip the pole.
3. With this configuration, you can put weight down on the pole, without having to grip the pole hard or even at all.
